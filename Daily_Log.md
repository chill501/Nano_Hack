## 27th 
Combine two fasta files

Search the plasmid database for hits - hit that keeps coming up and up.

Use longer reads - so that the seq dont hit a load of stuff 

Blast against just plasmids

ncbiwww module in Pyhton

## 28th

Use fast5 files 
Poretool to process fast5 files

Use BLAST
BLASTING AGAINST PLASMIDS
Type **plasmids (taxid:36549)** in organisms 

PLASMID SEARCH TOOLS:

### Fast5 Document Summary 

- [ ] Use poretools to extract fasta files from fsat5

which poretools *shows where poretools instaleled*

ls -lct | head *view files by time*






## TASKS

- [ ] read the fast5 format document sent by Sam (Claire and Hayley)
- [ ] work out Biopython and how to link to NCBI Blast (Alex and Emma)
